# op_LandPage

This project comes from the odin project where I am tasked
with re-creating an image of a website layout. Through this
I will be using a combination of html and css flexbox to 
create a proper landing page (LP) and practice fundamentals.

# desired outcome

A proper responsive LP that will be added to my portfolio.
